# Why using Karate?

## Karate DSL

**Karate** is a test automation framework that makes it easy to
test web services, APIs, and microservices.

Some reasons why I used Karate:

1. Easy to learn and use.
2. Karate integrates with build tools, like Maven and Gradle.
3. Karate supports **REST**, **SOAP**, and **GraphQL** APIs.
4. Karate provides built-in test reports.
5. Karate supports data-driven testing.

In summary, Karate is a versatile and user-friendly framework
that can help you test your APIs efficiently.
