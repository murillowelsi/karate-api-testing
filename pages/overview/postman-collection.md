# Postman Collection

In this project, I created a
**[Postman](../../collections/api_testing_service.postman_collection.json)**
collection to manually test the API Testing Service and understand a bit more about
the endpoints, following the Swagger documentation. The collection contains a set of
requests that cover all the endpoints to ensure that the API functions as expected.

To use the collection, you will need to import it into Postman. To do this, simply
click on the `Import` button in the top left corner of the Postman app, and select
the JSON file containing the collection. Once the collection is imported, you can run
the tests by clicking on the `Runner` button in the top right corner of the Postman app.
